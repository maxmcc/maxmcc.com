I'm a software designer, currently working at Apple in sunny California.

I graduated from the University of Pennsylvania in May 2016, with a Bachelor of
Arts in [cognitive science](https://web.sas.upenn.edu/cogsci/) and a Bachelor of
Applied Science in [computer and information
science](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/index.php).

At Penn, I served as head teaching assistant for [CIS
120](https://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis120/current/), a rigorous introduction to
functional programming and program design. I helped found
[Hack4Impact](http://hack4impact.org), a student group that designs and builds
software for nonprofit organizations. I also rowed on the lightweight crew for
two years.

You can get in touch with me by [email](mailto:hello@maxmcc.com) or on
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/_maxmcc), or check out some of my software projects
on [GitHub](https://github.com/maxmcc).
